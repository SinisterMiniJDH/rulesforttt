    <h1>Basic TTT Rules for Garry's Mod</h1>
    <div class="rule"><strong>Rule One:</strong> No blatant RDM. (killing people for no reason, Targeted RDM, excessive Accidental RDM, etc.)</div>
    <div class="rule"><strong>Rule Two:</strong> No excessive harassment. (actively following and inhibiting movement/shooting/survival of another player. Verbal harassment is ALLOWED if you don't like the words of another player you can just mute them. Also, just being a giant minge in general isn't allowed, you can be retarded, but if it's obvious that you don't care about the game and you just joined to minge, it can get you kicked or temp-banned.)</div>
    <div class="rule"><strong>Rule Three:</strong> No exploits/cheating/game-crashing. (if you find an exploit, please report it to a mod/admin. Obviously, if you cheat or are caught trying to crash the game, you will get temp or perm banned based on the severity.)</div>
    <div class="rule"><strong>Rule Four:</strong> No excessive racism. (you can joke and have fun but if it's obvious that you genuinely are shitting on other races for no reason other than "They're not my race" you'll get warned or kicked etc. You can make any joke you want, just don't act genuinely racist.)</div>
    <div class="rule"><strong>Rule Five:</strong> Metagaming/ghosting is not allowed. (e.g. you're in a call and you die and you tell your living buddy who killed you.)</div>
    <div class="rule"><strong>Rule Six:</strong> No AFK. (you can of course go AFK but if you're gone for an absurd amount of time you'll be kicked from the server, just rejoin if you wanna come back.)</div>
    <div class="rule"><strong>Rule Seven:</strong> No sexual/lewd content. (you can't do any sprays of porn or mic spam anything that's considered porn or lewd. This is TTT, not VR Chat.)</div>
    <div class="rule"><strong>Rule Eight:</strong> Staff disrespect IS ALLOWED. (if you think an admin is being unreasonable/an asshole, let them know. Your criticism is accepted.)</div>
